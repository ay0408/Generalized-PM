# Generalized Piecewise Mechanism (GPM) and Privacy-Optimized GPM for Collecting Multidimensional Data

In "Theoretical Comparison" folder, we compared our GPM with the existing methods in terms of the variance of collected private values.

"Privacy Guarantees" folder contains the codes for evaluating the achieved privacy guarantees for the entire (multidimensinal) data, when the privacy level regarding each attribute information was respectively given.

"Accuracy" folder provides the codes for evaluating the utility of our method using simulaton data, when the privacy budget for the entire data was given. (Our method allows more privacy budget to be distributed as each $\epsilon_i$ and achieves higher accuracy.)

In "RunTime.ipynb", we measured the run time to solve the minimization problem for obtaining the optimized $P_v$ in our enhanced GPM.
